							<h2>Project Scope and Motivation</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p><strong>Once upon a time,</strong> or really not that long ago, there are lots of diseases and germs being spread. Doors handles are one of the top ways these are spread. We intend to design a system that can be implemented on doors which allows for the same utilities as current push-latch doors, but gets rid of the need to touch a nasty door handle each time. </p>

							<h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p><strong>Issues</strong> that we might run into when the product goes into full production.</p>
							<ul class="feature-icons">
								<li class="icon solid fa-door-open">Installing on different material doors</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-leaf">Identifying high frequency doors</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-ruler-vertical">Finding best placement height</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-weight">Optimal force required for door latch</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-dumbbell">Identifying lightweight but stury material</li>
							</ul>
							<p><strong>Adding to exisiting Doors</strong> can bbe a challenge becuase now the door has two
								inputs for the door latch/lock. <strong>Making design more intuitive</strong> is necessary as 
								some people may not know what to do when seeing the footle.<strong>Finding best placement height</strong>
								can be a challenge as everyone's height differs and they all have different preferences on where to kick
								the door.<strong>Optimal force required</strong> is important because everyone has different leg strength
								to open the door. <strong>Sturdier/Stronger design</strong> is essential because the device is going to
								be kicked often which can take a lot of damage.</p>

										<h3>Use while moving in</h3>

On top of having the single handidly bring each box up, he didn't want to have to put the box down each time, open the door, then bend back over. Now, with the footle, he doesn't have to do that additional action each time he wants to open the door.</p>

							<p><strong>When we install the footle</strong> we want to see a certain number of interactions. We hope to see at least 10% of people use it. We want to keep this number low and realistic, as we will be supplementing the door handle.</p>

							<li><strong>Week 1 - Designing Website template and developing the design and idea of the Footle</strong></li>
							<ul>
								<li>
									For the first week, we mainly focused on strengthening the core foundation of the Footle from our Midterm Project.
									We focused on the actual technical and structural aspects that were not really mentioned 
								</li>
							</ul>
							<li><strong>Week 2</strong> - Meet with Professor to get inital feedback.</li>
							<li><strong>Week 3</strong> - Learn 3D model and begin prototyping our design of Footle.</li>
							<li><strong>Week 4</strong> - Make a working prototype and begin case study.</li>
							<li><strong>Week 5</strong> - Update our website with our case study images. </li>
