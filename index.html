						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p><strong>Once upon a time,</strong> or really not that long ago, there are lots of diseases and germs being spread. Doors handles are one of the top ways these are spread. We intend to design a system that can be implemented on doors which allows for the same utilities as current push-latch doors, but gets rid of the need to touch a nasty door handle each time. </p>

						<div class="content">
							<p><strong>Issues</strong> that we might run into when the product goes into full production.</p>
							<ul class="feature-icons">
								<li class="icon solid fa-door-open">Installing on different material doors</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-leaf">Identifying high frequency doors</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-ruler-vertical">Finding best placement height</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-weight">Optimal force required for door latch</li>
								<li style = "left:25%" class="icon solid fa-dumbbell">Identifying lightweight but sturdy material</li>
							</ul>
							<p><strong>Adding to exisiting Doors</strong> can be a challenge becuase now the door has two
								inputs for the door latch/lock. <strong>Making design more intuitive</strong> is necessary as 
								some people may not know what to do when seeing the footle.<strong>Finding best placement height</strong>
								can be a challenge as everyone's height differs and they all have different preferences on where to kick
								the door.<strong>Optimal force required</strong> is important because everyone has different leg strength
								to open the door. <strong>Sturdier/Stronger design</strong> is essential because the device is going to
								be kicked often which can take a lot of damage.</p>

										<h3>Use while moving in</h3>
										<p>Shion was moving into his apartment after an extremely long drive. On top of having the single handidly bring each box up, he didn't want to have to put the box down each time, open the door, then bend back over. Now, with the footle, he doesn't have to do that additional action each time he wants to open the door.</p>

							<h2>Impact Statement</h2>

						<div class="content">
							<p><strong>When we install the footle</strong> we want to see a certain number of interactions. We hope to see at least 10% of people use it. We want to keep this number low and realistic, as we will be supplementing the door handle.</p>

						<h2>Milestones</h2>
					</header>
					<div class="content">
						<p>Here is what we accomplished and will accomplish. (Starting Post-Midterm presentation)</p>
						
						<ul style = "list-style: none">
							<li><strong>Week 1 - Designing Website Template and Brainstorming</strong></li>
								<ul style = "list-style: none">
									<li>
										For the first week, we mainly focused on strengthening the core foundation of the Footle from our Midterm Project.
										We especially tackled technical and structural aspects that were not really mentioned during the Midterm presentation
										such as the material and height placement. Furthermore, we made a base template of the website that would be hosting
										our advertisement and act as our documentation of our whole design process. 
									</li>
								</ul>
							<li><strong>Week 2 - Professor Feedback and Planning Phase.</strong> </li>
								<ul style = "list-style: none">
									<li>
										For week 2, we mainly focused on going over the feedback we received from the professor on our initial design and website. 
										One of the main concerns she brought up was the lack of technical aspects within our project as well as a storyline that could really help sell the product. 
										She suggested developing some sort of story that would articulate the reasoning why the Footle is necessary. 
										To tackle the technical aspect, we realized that having a sensor that could track the number of users who would be utilizing the Footle would be beneficial for data collection. 
										Finally, we created milestones for our website to act as a plan of action that would highlight the big goals we tried to accomplish for our project. 
									</li>
								</ul>
							<li><strong>Week 3 - Learn and Design 3D model of the Footle.</strong></li>
								<ul style = "list-style: none">
									<li>
										After planning out our goals and designs, we got to the prototyping face through 3D models of the Footle. 
										This was not as difficult for us since we already had a cardboard prototype that we had developed in our midterm project. 
										We used SketchUp, a 3D modeling tool, to all individually design a mock use case scenario with the Footle in action. 
										These use cases included: gardeners with their hands full of tools, a new tenant moving into their apartment, a user calling someone with a cell phone, and a teacher who is trying to not spread germs. 
										These 3D modeling of the use cases gave us great inspiration and insights into Footle’s use cases and ultimately was decided to be used in our video demo. 
									</li>
								</ul>
							<li><strong>Week 4 - Make a working prototype and Recording our video.</strong></li>
								<ul style = "list-style: none">
									<li>
										When looking into making a working prototype, we had a few things that were very important to consider. The main consideration we had to make
										was durability. The footle is by nature a product that gets kicked. While most users are likely to use it with an acceptable amount of force, something
										we have to make considerations for are the users that are absolutely going to slam the footle. This means that our prototype has to be able to take a beating
										and still be able to work. With that in mind, we started thinking about what materials we could use for this. Our first thoughts were to use something like
										wood, however we then found a few problems with that. First of all, as a prototype, we cannot permanently affix anything to our doors. There are not many adheasives
										that will allow us to affix a protoype wooden footle to our door, and can easily be removed. We then thought our ultimate material would
										be to use something like aluminum, however for a prototype that is expensive and hard for us to work with since we do not have a materials
										shop readily avaliable to us.
										<br>
										<br>
										We ultimately decided to stick with a cardboard frame, and then double wrap the footle with duct tape. This gave us the rigidity necessary
										for the footle to maintain shape, as well as still being ductile enough to actually take a beating and maintain its shape. Moving forward,
										we would want to make our prototype out of a light weight, yet durable material like aluminum, however in the limited amount of time we had,
										our protype worked well.
										<br>
										<br>
										When making our video, we wanted to be sure to highlight some of our user stories we had experience with. This mainly had to do with
										our inspirations for a product like the footle; door handles are dirty, and our hands our often full. We were able to highlight most use
										cases where it was more work for a typical users to open the door with their hands than their feet.

								</ul>
							<li><strong>Week 5 - Update our website with our case study images.</strong></li>
								<ul style = "list-style: none">
									<li>
										Finally, to finish up our 436 final project, we needed to finish our website and update all of our observations of our real life use cases.
										This means including our final video that we worked really hard on, as well as explaining our reasoning for our prototyping choices.
										<br>
